## Load Magic Dataset
The following dataset was compiled by opening 15 draft booster boxes from recent Magic the Gathering Standard sets. 5 Boxes of Ikoria: Lair of Behemoths, 5 of Core 2021, and 5 of Zendikar Rising. Packs were opened and all cards inputted for the exception of tokens and basic land cards.
```{r cars}
MTG <- read.csv("MTG_data.csv")
MTG <- MTG %>%
  group_by(set, rep, card_name, rarity, card_type, finish, n, price) %>%
  summarise(total = sum(n))
MTG_norep <- MTG %>%
  group_by(set, card_name, rarity, card_type, finish, n, price) %>%
  summarise(total = sum(n))
```

##Vegan Set-up
```{r}
###Group main Data by Set, Rarity, Card Type, Finish, Total number and Price. Rep was removed from this dataset.
MTG_Vegan <- MTG_norep %>%
  group_by(set, rarity, card_type, card_name, finish, total, price) 

MTG_Vegan$rarity <- gsub(" ", "", MTG_Vegan$rarity)
MTG_Vegan$rarity <- as.factor(MTG_Vegan$rarity)
MTG_Vegan$uniID <- paste(MTG_Vegan$set, MTG_Vegan$rarity)
str(MTG_Vegan)

###Ungroup all and select the Unique ID, n, and total of specific card per box
library(dplyr)
MTG_Vegan <- MTG_Vegan %>% 
  ungroup()%>%
  dplyr::select(uniID, n, total)
MTG_Vegan <- MTG_Vegan %>% group_by(uniID, total) %>% summarise(Total = sum(n))

MTG_Vegan
###Spread the Data
commMTG <- MTG_Vegan %>% spread(total, Total)
commMTG[is.na(commMTG)] <- 0

##Drop Unique ID
commMTG <- commMTG %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  dplyr::select(-uniID)

commMTG

##Set up a mini-dataset to join the calculations to after. This dataset broken up by set and rarity.
setMTG <- MTG %>%
  group_by(set, rarity) %>%
  summarise(Total = sum(n))

setMTG$Total <- gsub(" ", "", setMTG$Total)
setMTG$Total <- as.factor(setMTG$Total)
setMTG$uniID <- paste(setMTG$set, setMTG$rarity)
str(setMTG)

setMTG <- setMTG %>%
  ungroup()%>%
  dplyr::select(uniID, set, rarity, Total)
setMTG <- setMTG %>% group_by(uniID, rarity)

setMTG <- setMTG %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  dplyr::select(-uniID)

##Run Simpsons test and Evenness for community data
##Note: Since many Mythics were only pulled ONCE during openings, many of the Simpsons and evenness calculations for Mythic cards result in either a 0 or NA
simpsonfinal <- diversity(commMTG, index = "simpson")
Hfinal <- diversity(commMTG)
Sfinal <- specnumber(commMTG)
Evenness <- Hfinal/log(Sfinal) 
setMTG$Simpson <- simpsonfinal
setMTG$Evenness <- Evenness

##Merge Data back to the main dataset
finalMTG <- merge(MTG_norep, setMTG)
```
